  <p class="text-white text-center py-4">
    A magician has a deck of cards, 52 cards, 13 of each suit (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs and Spades).<br>
    He will show us all of the cards and we will see that they are ordered and sorted by suit.<br>
    We are asked to shuffle the deck.<br>
    Then the magician takes the cards together and shakes them.<br>
    When he reveals the deck of cards once more, the cards have been ordered and sorted as before, as if it was a new deck of cards.<br>
    All the hearts are together and sorted from 1 to the King.
